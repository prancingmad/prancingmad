# 👋 Hi, I'm Andrew Gray, otherwise known as Prancing Mad on the web!

I'm a self-taught developer on a journey to become a full-time programmer.  
I began learning through **Boot.dev** in **July 2025**, starting with a strong focus on **Python**. Since then, I’ve been expanding into **Go** and **JavaScript** as I explore more of the tech world.

## 🧪 What I'm Working On
**🎲 D&D 5e Campaign Planner**  
A tool designed to make life easier for Dungeon Masters. It includes:
- Player and NPC information storage  
- Lore and worldbuilding organization  
- Generators for quick references and DM tools  
- A clean, simple interface for managing campaigns  

## 🛠️ Tech I’m Learning & Using
- **Python** — my first language and current comfort zone  
- **Go** — learning its simplicity and speed  
- **JavaScript** — diving deeper as I build more interactive tools, and building a game with a friend

## 🎯 Goals
- Continue leveling up as a programmer  
- Build useful tools, games, and apps  
- Contribute more to open-source projects
- Find a career in programming, to continue furthering my skills and become the most proficient programmer that I can

Thanks for stopping by! 🚀
